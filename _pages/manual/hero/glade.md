In this scene the player fights an ape that is controlled by an evil mask. It jumps into the glade as the player moves into it. They can blow off the rocks that protect its arms and legs using bombs. The ape can also be stunned with nuts or enraged by hitting the mask. The sling can be used to easily deal direct damage. Once the ape runs out of health a cutscene plays showing the mask come off and the maskless ape fleeing.
