## Welcome

This is the manual for Action Adventure Kit by SoftLeitner. Action Adventure Kit is quite the mouthful so i will be referring to it using the shorthand AAK.  

## Feedback

The quickest channels to reach me are mail and discord. Please feel free to reach out with any problems and questions. Feedback regarding the general direction of AAK and particular future features are also always welcome. Though I might not immediately be able to incorporate your requests I very much take them into consideration when planning out future updates.  

If you can spare the time please consider leaving a review in the asset store.
