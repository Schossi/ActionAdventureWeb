## 1.0.1

### ADDED

- manual page for SoulsPlayer(includes step by step guide for replacing the model)

### CHANGED

- Animator is now part of CharacterBase, AnimatedCharacterBase is therefore obsolete

### IMPROVED

- simplified model replacement for SoulsPlayer
  - colliders moved to separate GameObject 'Body'
  - TimelineAction and SoulsBonfireAction can pass character animator to the PlayableDirector which lets us remove the dependency between environment and player model
- translation and rotation of model can be suppressed independently
  - SoulsAttackAction no longer locks rotation until damage is activated
- MovementSaver can be overridden from outside
  - BossArena uses this to properly reset the player if the game is quit during a fight
- intro sequence can now be skipped
- 2021 LTS compatibility

### FIXED

- usable items not being hidden if action is interrupted
- potential initialization order errors
  - AttributePool value/stat dictionaries
  - CharacterActionArea Bindings
- armor no longer vanishes at certain camera angles
